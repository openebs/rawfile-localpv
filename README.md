## RawFile-LocalPV
The RawFile-LocalPV OpenEBS Data-Engine is a simialr but more flexible, yet more complex.. derication of the LocalPV-Hostpath Data-Engine. <BR>

This are a few reasons to consider using node-based (rather than network-based) storage architetcure:
> - Performance: Almost no network-based storage solution can keep up with baremetal disk performance in terms of IOPS/latency/throughput combined. And you’d like to get the best out of the SSD you’ve got!
> - On-premise Environment: You might not be able to afford the cost of upgrading all your networking infrastructure, to get the best out of your network-based storage solution.
> - Complexity: Network-based solutions are distributed systems. And distributed systems are not easy! You might want to have a system that is easier to understand and to reason about. Also, with less complexity, you can fix unpredicted issues more easily.

### Using node-based storage
The OpenEBS LocalPV-HostPath Data-Engine makes it pretty easy to automatically provision hostPath PVs and use them in your workloads. But, there are known limitations though:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - You can’t monitor volume usage: There are hacky workarounds to run “du” regularly, but that could prove to be a performance killer, since it could put a lot of burden on your CPU and cause your filesystem cache to fill up. Not really good for a production workload.
> - You can’t enforce hard limits on your volume’s size: Again, you can hack your way around it, with the same caveats.
> - You are stuck with whatever filesystem your kubelet node is offering
> - You can’t customize your filesystem:

<BR>
### All the above issues stem from the same root cause: 
   - hostPath/LocalPVs are simple bind-mounts from the host filesystem into the pod.

### The idea behind RawFile-LocalPB 
To use a Filesystem based 'extant file' as the emulated block device (i.e. a soft-LUN block device), and leverage the LINUX loop device to associate that soft-LUN file as a complete flexibe block device (i.e. an emulated soft disk device). At this point you can create a PV with a fileystem on it. This allows you to...
> [!NOTE]
> - You can monitor volume usage by running `df -hT` in `O(1)` since each soft-LUN block device is mounted separately on the local node (displaying utilization status/metrics or each mountpoint).
> - The size limit is enforced by the operating system, based on the backing file system capacity and soft-lun device file size.
> - Since volumes are backed by different files, each soft-lin device file can be formatted using different filesystems, and/or customized with different filesystem options.
